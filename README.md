Salary Prediction using ANN
📌 Project Overview

This project is a Machine Learning model built using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict employee salaries based on given features.
The model is trained on structured data and saved in .keras format.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy, Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn

📂 Project Files

salary_prediction.ipynb → Jupyter Notebook for data preprocessing, model training, and saving.

predict_salary.py → Script to load the trained model and make predictions.

salary_model.keras → Trained ANN model.

salary_prediction.csv → Dataset used for training.

🚀 How to Use

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/SA12352/SALARY-PREDICTOR-APP.git
cd SALARY-PREDICTOR-APP



Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the notebook (salary_prediction.ipynb) to train and save the model.

Use predict_salary.py to test predictions with new input data.

📊 Model Architecture
